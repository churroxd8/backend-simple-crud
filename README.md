# Simple CRUD

This is just a quick CRUD backend for reference made in NodeJS. In this case, I used MongoDB as the database but that doesn't matter much.

## For future self

Some notes to take for myself because my memory sucks:
- Use `npm install` to install all the dependencies; that includes Nodemon for the server activity and changes.
- If you're using MongoDB and want to take this as a reference for CRUD activities, just change the cluster credentials (same as DB credentials).
- The stack here is basically backend, without the frontend part, so no React or anything interactive here.
- Yoy can use Insomnia or Postman to test the API routes, don't be stupid!
- Happy hacking
